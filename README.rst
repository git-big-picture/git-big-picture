``git-big-picture`` is a visualization tool for Git repositories. You can think
of it as a filter that removes uninteresting commits from a DAG modelling a Git
repository and thereby exposes the big picture: for example the hierarchy of
tags and branches. ``git-big-picture`` supports convenience output options and
can filter different classes of commits. It uses the Graphviz utility to render
images that are pleasing to the eye.

A Small Example
---------------

Imagine the following Graph:

.. code::

             0.1.1   0.1.2
               |       |
    0.0    G---H---I---J---K---L---M maint
     |    /
     A---B---C---D---E---F master
         |    \         /
        0.1    N---O---P topic


Where the following commits have Branches and Tags:

.. code::

    A -> 0.0
    B -> 0.1
    F -> master
    H -> 0.1.1
    J -> 0.1.2
    M -> maint
    P -> topic

The *reduced* graph of *interesting* commits would be:

.. code::

          H---J---M
         /
    A---B---F
         \ /
          P

But since the commits would be labeled with their refs, it would look more like
(within the limits of ASCII art):

.. code::

          0.1.1---0.1.2---maint
         /
    0.0---0.1---master
            \     /
             topic

Screenshots
-----------

Courtesy of Graphviz, ``git-big-picture`` can output nice images.

Here is the original repository from the example above:

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/git-big-picture/git-big-picture/master/screenshots/before.png
    :height: 280px
    :width:  456px

And here is the reduced version:

.. image:: https://raw.github.com/git-big-picture/git-big-picture/master/screenshots/after.png
    :height: 280px
    :width:  456px

We also have a real world examples from:

* `cython <https://raw.github.com/git-big-picture/git-big-picture/master/screenshots/cython-big-picture.png>`_
* `PyMVPA <https://raw.github.com/git-big-picture/git-big-picture/master/screenshots/pymvpa-big-picture.png>`_
* `bloscpack <https://raw.github.com/git-big-picture/git-big-picture/master/screenshots/bloscpack-big-picture.png>`_

Dependencies
------------

* Python >=3.6
* Git (1.7.1 works)
* Graphviz utility
* Nosetest and Scruf (only for running tests)

Installation
------------

As of ``v0.10.1`` you may install it from PyPI:

https://pypi.org/project/git-big-picture/

.. code:: console

   $ pip install git-big-picture

Alternatively, Just run it straight from a clone or download:

.. code:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/git-big-picture/git-big-picture.git
    $ cd git-big-picture
    $ ./git-big-picture --help

    $ wget https://raw.github.com/git-big-picture/git-big-picture/master/git-big-picture
    $ chmod 755 git-big-picture
    $ ./git-big-picture -h

Alternatively, use the standard ``setup.py`` script to install it system wide
or just for the user.

.. code:: console

    $ ./setup.py install
    (may need root privileges)
    $ ./setup.py install --user

Git Integration
---------------

You can easily integrate this script as a regular Git command, by making the
script ``git-big-picture`` available on the ``$PATH``. For instance: using
``./setup.py install`` method, as described above should do the trick.
Alternatively symlink or copy ``git-big-picture`` into a directory listed in
your ``$PATH``, for example ``$HOME/bin``.

You may then use ``git big-picture`` (w/o the first dash) as you would any other Git command:

.. code:: console

    $ git big-picture -h

Or create an alias:

.. code:: console

    $ git config --global alias.bp big-picture
    $ git bp -h

Internals
---------

The graph operations are written in Python and output the graph-data in the
easy-to-write Graphviz syntax. This is converted into an image using the
Graphviz ``dot`` utility. Graphviz supports a multitude of image formats, e.g. SVG
and PDF. Check that Graphviz is installed by invoking: ``dot -V``.

        -I, --no-bifurcations
                            do not include bifurcation commits

Usage Examples
--------------

There are two related groups of options, the output and the filter options.
Output options govern the output and format produced by the tool. Filter
options govern which commits to include when calculating the reduced graph.

Using Output Options
....................

Generate PNG version of current Git repository and save to ``our-project.png``:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -o our-project.png

Generate SVG (default format) image of the repository in ``~/git-repo`` and view the
result in Firefox:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -v firefox ~/git-repo/

If you specify the format and a filename with extension, the filename extension will
be used:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -f svg -o our-project.png
    $ file our-project.png
    our-project.png: PNG image data, 216 x 325, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced

If you don't have an extension, you could still specify a format:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -f pdf -o our-project
    warning: Filename had no suffix, using format: pdf

Otherwise the default format SVG is used:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -o our-project
    warning: Filename had no suffix, using default format: svg

If you would like to use an alternative viewer, specify viewer and its format:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -f pdf -v xpdf

You can also open the viewer automatically on the output file:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -v xpdf -o our-project.pdf

Output raw Graphviz syntax:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -g

Output raw Graphviz output (i.e. the image):

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -p

Note however, that the options in the two examples above are both mutually
exclusive and incompatible with other output options.

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -g -p
    fatal: Options '-g | --graphviz' and '-p | --processed' are mutually exclusive.
    $ git-big-picture -g -v firefox
    fatal: Options '-g | --graphviz' and '-p | --processed' are incompatible with other output options.

Manually pipe the Graphviz commands to the ``dot`` utility:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture --graphviz ~/git-repo | dot -Tpng -o graph.png

Using Filter Options
....................

The three options ``--branches`` ``--tags`` and ``--roots`` are active by
default. You can use the negation switches to turn them off. These use the
uppercase equivalent of the short option and the prefix ``no-`` for the long
option. For example: ``-B | --no-branches`` to deactivate showing branches.

Show all interesting commits, i.e. show also merges and bifurcations:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -i -m

Show only roots (deactivate branches and tags):

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -B -T

Show merges and branches only (deactivate tags):

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -m -T

Show all commits:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -a

Configuration
-------------

The standard ``git config`` infrastructure can be used to configure
``git-big-picture``. Most of the command line arguments can be configured in a
``big-picture`` section. For example, to configure ``firefox`` as a viewer

.. code:: console

    $ git config --global big-picture.viewer firefox

Will create the following section and entry in your ``~/.gitconfig``:

.. code:: ini

    [big-picture]
        viewer = firefox


The command line negation arguments can be used to disable a setting configured
via the command line. For example, if you have configured the ``viewer`` above
and try to use the ``-g | --graphviz`` switch, you will get the following
error:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -g
    fatal: Options '-g | --graphviz' and '-p | --processed' are incompatible with other output options.

... since you already have a viewer configured. In this case, use the negation
option ``-V | --no-viewer`` to disable the ``viewer`` setting from the config
file:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -g -V


Development
-----------

git-big-picture uses `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_, both locally and in the CI.
To activate the same local pre-commit Git hooks for yourself, you could do:

.. code:: console

    $ pip install pre-commit
    $ pre-commit install --install-hooks

When you do a commit after that, pre-commit will run the checks
configured in file ``.pre-commit-config.yaml``.


Testing
-------

The Python code is tested with `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_:

.. code:: console

    $ ./test.py

The command line interface is tested with `Scruf <https://gitlab.com/matthewhughes/scruf>`_:

.. code:: console

    $ PATH="${PWD}:${PATH}" ./test.scf

Debugging
---------

You can use the ``[-d | --debug]`` switch to debug:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture -d -v firefox

Although debugging output is somewhat sparse...


Profiling
---------

There are two ways to profile git-big-picture, using the built-in ``--pstats``
option or using the Python module ``cProfile``:

Using ``--pstats``:

.. code:: console

    $ git-big-picture --pstats=profile-stats -o graph.svg

... will write the profiler output to ``profile-stats``.

Profile the script with ``cProfile``

.. code:: console

    $ python -m cProfile -o profile-stats git-big-picture -o graph.svg

In either case, you can then use the excellent visualisation tool `gprof2dot
<http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/Gprof2Dot>`_ which, incidentally,
uses Graphviz too:

.. code:: console

    $ gprof2dot -f pstats profile-stats | dot -Tsvg -o profile_stats.svg
